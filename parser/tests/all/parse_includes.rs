// fri jared üëç remove location from Block, it will be inferred from content
// as it can cross include files

// thursday jared üëç get this test passing w/ new inline node type, review other `jared` notes
// remember the parser or somthing has to hold on to source file names and suchlike
// maybe do an audit of `usize as u32` and `usize as u16` to see if it's easier to flip polarity for perf
